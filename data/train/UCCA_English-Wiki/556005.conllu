# text = Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation : " I was n't popular in school ... I failed music - only thing I ever failed . And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth , ' cause nobody knew I even sang . It was amazing how popular I became after that . "
